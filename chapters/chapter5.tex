\section{Introduction}
% background
\subsection{Background}
%
Urban rail transit is a type of high-capacity public transport generally found in urban areas. Because of the rapid, punctual and environment-friendly features, the urban rail transit is becoming one of the most important travel modes in modern cities. With the popularity of the urban rail transit in modern cities and the emphasis on sustainable development, the concept of TOD (Transit Oriented Development) is putting forward, intended to build the compact city \cite{calthorpe1993next}. Many cities around the world have adopted the policy of giving priority to the development of public transport for decreasing the share of motorized travel and increasing the willingness of using public transit. For policymakers, how to grasp the relation between land-use and transit ridership has become an important issue that they must face.

%
Although there have been lots of research on the relationship between land-use and transit ridership, most of them are conducted from the perspective of the single station. The transit ridership of a station, however, should be affected not only by the elements around that station, but also be affected by the transit ridership of other stations, since all the stations are running in the same system.  Once the circumstance within catchment area changes, obviously, the ridership of this station will change as well. But the increased part of passengers will be transported to other stations, thus every station connected to that station will also have an increase in ridership. 

% why focus on the ridership at station-to-station level
\subsection{Research purpose}
%
Some researchers have discussed on the issue of inter-urban transit demand at station-to-station level \cite{wardman1997inter,jones1983demand}. Nevertheless, restricted by the difficulties in collecting data onto station-to-station level, very little studies focus on the intra-urban transit ridership \cite{choi2012analysis}. Even now, the transit ridership forecasting at station-to-station level is still difficult due to the complex interaction among stations. 

Based on this realistic background, this study will focus on the relation between station and station from the perspective of land-use. But rather than making the prediction of transit ridership between station and station, this study tries to explain what factors of land-use can influence the choice of destination station for passengers. 

\section{Literature review}
%
Until now, there are many studies focusing on the relationship between various factors and transit ridership. Most of the studies are based on the regression model and conducted from the view of station-level, the transit ridership is thought to be affected by the circumstance surrounding the station \cite{cervero1997travel,taylor2003analyzing,zhao2005transit,estupinan2008relationship,taylor2009nature,sohn2010factors,gutierrez2011transit,jun2015land}. Among them, the multiple linear regression models are the earliest and most widely used model \cite{cervero1997travel,gutierrez2011transit}. However, the data point in ordinary least squares (OLS) models is viewed as a single point. It is not consistent with fact that the transit node is connected to each other. To deal with the relationship between stations in the same network, the spatial regression is also introduced into this issue \cite{cardozo2012application,jun2015land}. Nevertheless, this relationship between stations in spatial regression models is just the expression of the distribution relationship of stations in location, which cannot reflect the real connectivity between two station areas.

%
To explore the connectivity between station areas, Choi worked on a station-to-station level investigation into the effect of both origins and destinations on OD metro ridership of Seoul, Korea by using the data from the automatic fare collection system \cite{choi2012analysis}. The influencing factors are divided into three groups: the factors of departure stations, the factors of destination stations, and the factors of impedance between stations. The influence of OD ridership is estimated using multiplicative and Poisson regression, at the time slot of morning, evening peak hours, and midday hours. This station-to-station approach has connected stations by using the factors of both origin and destination. As a result of this empirical study, different land-use functions have different travel characteristics in terms of both time and space. But there was a problem not well tackled in this study, that although the factors of departure stations and destination stations are separately constructed, they were not distinguished in the process of estimating the model. 

%
Land-use and public transit are coevolving partners in urban planning \cite{handy2005smart,dittmar2012new}. In the urban railway transit system, the ridership between stations is thought to be related to land-use, distribution of functional regions or travel preferences \cite{thompson1997achieving}. The catchment area of a station is the area with mixed land-use of residences, business, and leisure within walking distance taking the station as the center, while the transit ridership between stations can be viewed as the connectivity of different catchment areas. The catchment area is generally referring to a compact residential district with mixing land-use, which allows people to accomplish most of their daily activities within an easy walking distance from a major transit node \cite{lund2004travel}. In detail, various types of land-use are the carrier for people to live, work and recreate, different types of land-use correspond different trip purposes. If the land-use within the easy walking distance from a station cannot satisfy the requirement of people’s daily activities, people will choose to go to other places to conduct their business by using the transit node such as the subway. It can be inferred that the land-use of a catchment area not only can affect the ridership of the station where it is located but also can affect the ridership of other stations connected to that station.

%
With the goal of explaining the variation in the ridership between stations, this study focuses on the passengers’ choices of destination stations from the perspective of land-use. The study case is the subway network of Fukuoka, Japan. The contents are organized as follows: section two reviews the previous research about transit ridership; section three is the description of the data; section four interprets the methodology; section five is the result of the logistic model; section six gives the discussion on the result and draws the conclusion. The flow of research process is shown in Figure \ref{fig:chp5:Chp5Flowchart}.

\section{Data}

%
\subsection{Case introduction}
%
This study focuses on 35 subway stations in Fukuoka City (the sixth largest city in Japan) which has the largest population in Kyushu Island of Japan (more than 1.5 million). Figure \ref{fig:chp4:ResearchArea}, gives the research area and the distribution of subway stations. Until now Fukuoka has three operating subway lines, a total of 29.8 km operating mileage. The transport system carries a daily average of more than 0.6 million passengers by 2015 that accounting for more than 20\% in total motorized travel (from Fukuoka City Transportation Bureau). Although the Fukuoka subway system is not a large-scale one, it plays a crucial role in public transportation in terms of the city scale and population. 

%
The same with the catchment area used in chapter 4, it is also the road-network-based 800-meter walking distance in this chapter. Then the factors considered to have influences on the passengers' choices of destination stations are extracted from this 800-meter pedestrian catchment area. The follows give the interpretations of the indicators used in this study.

%
\subsection{Land-use factors}
%
Land-use is generally accepted as one of the determinants for transit ridership. The indicator of different types of floor area can be considered as a detailed expression for land-use. This influence of floor area is extensively confirmed in previous studies \cite{sohn2010factors,gutierrez2011transit,chakraborty2013land,chakraborty2013land,jun2015land}. Moreover, since all the stations in the network are connected, the change of land-use within the PCA of a station will lead to the changes of transit ridership in all the stations in the same network. In Fukuoka, near 90\% in the trips of accessing transit stations are non-motorized (refer to Table \ref{tab:chp4:AccessToStations}). It represents that the land-use around the station is playing a crucial role in determining the trip purposes of transit users.

%
The same with previous studies, this study chose several types of land-use with higher proportion to assess the indicator of land-use diversity, including residential, office, commercial, education. The four main types of land-use account for near 85\% of all the floor area in Fukuoka City, especially in subway PCA, reaching more than 90\%, which refers to Table \ref{tab:chp4:ProportionOfLanduse}. In addition to the indicator of floor area, the index of the land-use diversity is also assumed to be a crucial factor in explaining the connectivity of stations \cite{badoe2000transportation,cervero2004transit,frank2004obesity}. Unlike the general definition of land-use diversity, this study redefines it into the aggregation of land-use. The Euclidean Metric is used for evaluating the deviation between the land-use aggregation in each subway station and the reference value. The value of this indicator is ranged from 0 to 1, in which the lower value represents a higher diversity of land-use, while the higher value means the land-use is less diverse. This indicator of land-use aggregation is defined as for Equation \ref{eq:chp4:LanduseAggregation}, it is speculated to have a negative impact on ridership. The balance proportion of land-use types is decided by the average proportion of all subway station PCA (800 meters) in Fukuoka City (refer to Table \ref{tab:chp4:ProportionOfLanduse}). There are five types of land-use being selected as the indicator in this study, the list of indicators also the statistical descriptions refer Table \ref{tab:chp5:StationToStationFactorStatistics}.

%
\subsection{Impedance factors}
%
Another factor generally used for representing the connectivity between stations is the remoteness, which is also widely adopted as impedance in the gravity model for explaining the connectivity between traffic zones \cite{iwanow2007trade,kepaptsoglou2010gravity,nitsch2000national}. Impedance is an index which is used to represent the connectivity and cost between departure and destination. It can affect the choice of the trip in terms of both destination and travel mode. Generally, the factor of impedance can be considered from two aspects in this issue, one is the internal impedance that representing the convenience for accessing the station \cite{chu2004ridership,chakraborty2013land}; the other is external impedance that evaluating the connectivity between stations \cite{sohn2010factors}. For Fukuoka, there are about 90\% of all the trip accessing stations by walking and bicycles (refer to Table \ref{tab:chp4:AccessToStations}). Since the PCA is set by the pedestrian distance, the area is already representing the internal road impedance. The indicator of internal road impedance is not included in this study. For the external impedance, the operation distance between stations is first to be considered as the reflection of the spatial connectivity between two stations. 

Additionally, the impedance of competing modes is also considered in this study. Two indicators of bus accessibility and bus capacity are proposed referring to Equation \ref{eq:chp4:BusCapacity} and Equation \ref{eq:chp4:BusAccessibility} respectively. The former is used for representing the convenience for accessing the station which is speculated as a positive factor of transit ridership, while the later is the transport capacity of the bus within the PCA of the station which is considered as a negative factor of transit ridership because it may share part of ridership from the subway. Table \ref{tab:chp5:StationToStationFactorStatistics} lists the statistical description for the indicators.

%
\section{Methods}
%
\subsection{Flow of the method}
It is difficult to analyze the connectivity of all the stations simultaneously. To simplify this issue, the study will be started by one single station, and then the connectivity between this station and all the other stations connected to it will be investigated. For a passenger, the behavior of going to some places by subway can be viewed as a procedure of choice. In this selection process, the choice is decided by the trip purpose of the passenger. As stated in the introduction, the type of building functions can be mainly categorized into residence, office, education, and commerce, which represent the trip purposes of going home, business, commute, and leisure respectively. Therefore, this issue can be converted into a discrete choice model, in which the dependent variables are the building environment in the station catchment area, and the independent variable is the choice of the destination station.

%
\subsection{Logistic regression}
If investigating any one of the stations, passengers have the choices of alighting or not alighting at this object station. The probability of alighting at this object station can be viewed as the connection between the departure and the destination. In this way, this issue can be converted into a binary choice problem. Therefore the transit ridership between stations can be explained by investigating the probability of alighting at the object station. The binary-logistic regression is introduced to estimate this converted binary choice issue. Formula \ref{eq:chp5:LogisticRegression} shows the expression of binary-logistic regression.

	p_i(y_i=1 \mid X_i)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\alpha +X_i)}}

%
For the estimation of a regression model, the model of logistic regression built in this study is a non-linear regression model, which can be directly estimated by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Thus, the MLE is adopted to estimate the coefficient. In this study, the sample size is the passenger volume of all the departure stations connected to the investigated destination station, which is marked as $N$. The same with Equation \ref{eq:chp5:LogisticRegression}, $p_i$ is the probability for choosing to get off, thus, $1-p_i$ represents the probability for choosing not to get off. Then the occurrence probability $L(\theta)$ in all observation sample can be expressed as Equation \ref{eq:chp5:MLE}:

% Equation 5
\begin{equation}
	L(\theta)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}{p_i}^{y_i}(1-p_i)^{(1-y_i)}

\section{Results}
%
The characteristic of land-use within the PCA of a station can represent the characteristic of passengers departing from that station. Since a city is the collection of different functional regions, the land-use characteristics of each PCA are also different. To explore the connectivity between stations with different types of land-use characteristics, this study firstly classifies all the stations in terms of the proportion of different function of land-use and population density. Then the typical stations are chosen from each group of different land-use type, thereby estimating the connectivity between stations by conducting the logistic regression. 

\subsection{Selection of object station}
%
As the result, all the stations are fallen into six categories, they are medium-density residence, high-density residence, education, office, commerce, and airport (refer to Figure \ref{fig:chp3:StationClassification}). Detailed statistics for each type is shown in Table \ref{tab:chp5:StationClassification}, the average values of attributions in each group are represented, furthermore, the factors of bus service and land-use aggregation are also put in this table to help to observe the difference among groups. As is shown, both the group of medium-density residence and the group of high-density residence have a higher proportion of residence floor area, but there is a significant difference in the population density of the two groups. It is clearly that the education type has the highest proportion of education floor area. Both office and commerce types have a higher proportion of office than other types, but the commerce proportion of commerce type is also higher than other types. Additionally, the station of Fukuoka airport does not belong to any group, which mainly takes the feeder traffic from the airport to urban area. The station classification also shows that the residence and office type have a relatively lower land-use aggregation and higher population density.

%
To investigate the stations with significant differences in land-use characteristic, the most typical object station is chosen from each group in terms of the guidelines as follows: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Avoid selecting the stations with the highest value of feature indicator. Because the high value may be caused by the particularity of its distribution of land-use and road network, it does not have generality in terms of the type it is.
	\item Avoid selecting the transferable stations. Because the transit ridership of this kind of stations generally relates the other stations, which cannot reflect the distribution of land-use within the PCA.
	\item Avoid selecting the stations with much lower or higher population density than other stations. Because the low or high population density may lead to different travel preference due to the difference in the distribution of facilities (such as hospitals, schools, and transportation facilities etc.).
	\item Finally, six stations are selected from six groups, the factor of each station is shown in Table \ref{tab:chp5:Result}.

\subsection{Estimation of logistic regression}
%
In this study, the independent variable is the choice of alighting or not alighting at the object station; the influencing factors are land-use and impedance between stations and stations. The result of estimation is shown in Table \ref{tab:chp5:Result}.

% 1，2，3号线分开处理，但是不想写这段了
% Notably, the subway network of Fukuoka, subway line 3 is not directly connected with that line 1 and line 2, thus subway line 3 is addressed separately from subway line 1 and line 2. That is, if the object station belongs to subway line 3, the connectivity will be only investigated within subway line 3. 

%
The estimation is shown in Table \ref{tab:chp5:Result}. The values of gray cell indicate no statistical significance at the confidence level of 0.05. The index of $Exp(B)$, which is the odds ratio, represents the variation in the probability of choice when the coefficient $B$ changes one unit. Here giving a brief explanation of the index of $Exp(B)$. For the variables of land-use, the index of $Exp(B)$ represents that the 1 percent (0.01 unit) variation in the variable will lead to an $Exp(B)$ multiples of increases in the probability of getting off at the object station. For the variables of impedance, it means the 1 unit change in the variables will lead to an $Exp(B)$ multiples of increases in the probability of choosing to alight at the object station.

The following is a detailed description taking the Tenjin station as an example. From the point of land-use, the increase in commerce and office floor area in the catchment area of the boarding stations can lead to a decrease in the probability of choosing the Tenjin station as the destination station; while the increase of residence and education floor area in the catchment area of boarding stations can raise the probability of choosing to go the Tenjin station. If interpreted in terms of connectivity, the business type of Tenjin Station is weakly connected to stations with the same commercial type, and the stations of office type; while the stations of business type have relatively strong connectivity with the stations of residence and education type.

\section{Discussion and conclusion}
%
This study investigated the connectivity between stations with different land-use characteristic by examining the passengers' choice of the destination station. As shown in Table \ref{tab:chp5:StationClassification}, the PCA of the station in Fukuoka shows a significant characteristic of land-use distribution, and all the subway stations are categorized into six major types. The result of logistic regression shows the coefficient of factor influencing the choice of the destination station, which can be explained as the connectivity between different PCAs.

Some findings of the land-use factors can be known from the result shown in Table \ref{tab:chp5:Result}. The increase in the proportion of residence area of the departure station can lead to an increase in the choice of taking the office and education type station as destination stations. This can be explained as the result of commuter traffic since there is a relatively stronger connectivity between the residential area and working area \cite{badoe2000transportation}. But the situation may change in the medium-residence type due to different travel preferences. Another interesting finding is that all kinds of land-use have positive connectivity with the education type station. One speculation is that students tend to take public transit because of the low income. Overall, one kind of land-use generally shows a rejection effect on the station which has the alike consist of land-use type. Such as the Tenjin station located in the CBD area, the proportion of commerce area in the PCA of departure station causes a negative effect on the choice of getting off at Tenjin station. Moreover, the variable of land-use aggregation shows that there is a positive connectivity between the areas with an unbalanced distribution of land-use.

The factors of impedance also showed a good statistical significance, however, the results do not seem to show a certain regularity in different types of stations. Here some possible speculations of the reasons are given for helping to find the limitation of this study and explore the direction for the next study. First, the share of different transportation modes is not considered in this study. The distance between two stations may also affect the variation in the share of different transportation modes, thus it is not stable in representing the impedance.  Second, the variable of bus service describes the feature of one single station, but not the connectivity between two stations. If considering two stations, one is in the downtown where the transportation hub locates, and one is in suburban where there are few public transportation facilities; it can be inferred that even though the bus service is rich in the downtown area, it affects little on the station located in the suburban area.

As the conclusions, 1. the probability of choosing a station as the destination tends to decrease if the land-use types are similar between the departure and destination stations; 2. the probability of choosing a station as the destination which belongs to low-density residence type has no tendency to raise regarding the variation of land-use in the departure station; 3. for any type of stations, the education land-use in the departure station contributes to an increase in the probability of choosing that station as the destination.

%
In summary, this study described the transit ridership between stations by using the choice of destination. The results indicate land-use types of the catchment area have significant influences on the choice of destination, while the influence of impedance was not clearly confirmed yet. Nevertheless, the impedance between stations is supposed to have influences on the choice of destination. Since the impedance contains various types of transportation modes, such as private cars, rail transit, bus, walking, etc., it is recommended investigating the influence of impedance from the perspective of different transportation modes.
