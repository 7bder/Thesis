	abstract = {Interest in active transportation--especially walking and cycling--is growing within urban planning and transportation circles as a solution to the environmental and congestion issues plaguing many cities. This paper focuses on how far people are willing to walk or cycle for different trip purposes in Montreal, Canada, and how travel distances vary spatially and by individuals' travel purpose and socio-economic characteristics. The research uses the 2003 Montreal Origin-Destination Survey (O-D Survey) to calculate the network distance traveled by pedestrians and cyclists and to obtain travel and socio-economic characteristics for each individual. Whereas walking distance literature often focuses on distance to transit, this paper examines walking and cycling trips where a second transit mode is not the intended destination. Primarily, the paper reveals that median walking distances recorded in the O-D survey (650 metres) are greater than the commonly-accepted distance or catchment area of 400 metres; various personal built environment factors influence these distances. While no widely-held standard exists for cycling, the analysis reveals a median distance of around two kilometres with a high degree of variation in distances. The findings will guide planners, designers, developers, and policy makers and suggest future research directions within the field. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The dilemma between overfitting and achieving maximum accuracy is seldom resolved. A method to construct a decision tree based classifier is proposed that maintains highest accuracy on training data and improves on generalization accuracy as it grows in complexity. The classifier consists of multiple trees constructed systematically by pseudorandomly selecting subsets of components of the feature vector, that is, trees constructed in randomly chosen subspaces. The subspace method is compared to single-tree classifiers and other forest construction methods by experiments on publicly available datasets, where the method's superiority is demonstrated.

The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved.

	abstract = {This paper reports on a survey of pedestrian trips to transit that examined the trip lengths and route choices made by people walking to five rail transit stations in California and Oregon. In highly motorized countries such as the US, policy-makers are beginning to recognize that shifting some travel from auto trips to walking trips can help the country achieve important policy objectives such as combating obesity and reducing the air pollution and oil dependency that result from auto use. However, researchers know very little about pedestrian behaviour and the role of the built and aesthetic environment in influencing pedestrian trips to transit. As communities wrestle with the interconnected issues of obesity, sprawl, and quality of life, planners need to understand how far Americans will walk to transit and the environmental factors that influence them. This survey of 328 pedestrians walking to rail stations, primarily on weekday mornings, found that they were willing to walk an average of half a mile to the rail station and that minimizing the distance walked was the most important factor influencing their choice of route. The people surveyed also frequently mentioned safety factors as important in route choice. Aesthetic elements of the built environment, on the other hand, were rarely mentioned as important route choice factors. The paper concludes by using these survey findings to recommend strategies that planners, designers, and policy-makers can use to design successful transit and pedestrian-oriented developments.},

	abstract = {Access and egress are the weakest links in a public transport chain and determine the availability and convenience of public transport. Initiatives aimed at improving access and egress hold potential to significantly reduce public transport trip time and are inexpensive options compared to the expensive infrastructure and vehicle enhancement alternatives frequently considered. Accurate estimates of access and egress times, however, are often in short supply. Use is made of a comprehensive travel-activity diary to collect detail travel time estimates. The results suggest that access and egress times are a function of access and egress modes and trip orientation rather than of socio-demographic characteristics. Land-use has a different impact on access and egress and in both cases the relationship seems non-linear.Access and egress times increase with increasing trip time, however, the increase is not as strong as line-haul time and as a result the interconnectivity ratio (access and egress time as proportion of total trip time) declines as trip time increases. For most multimodal trips, the ratio falls within a modest range of 0.2-0.5. The results can be used, amongst other, in planning the catchment area of public transport and predicting choice sets of realistic multimodal trips. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Background: Walking distance is an important concept in the fields of transportation and public health. A distance of 0.25 miles is often used as an acceptable walking distance in U.S. research studies. Overall, research on the distance and duration of walking trips for different purposes and across different population groups remains limited. Purpose: This study examines the prevalence of walking and distances and durations of walking trips for different purposes among U.S. residents. Methods: The distances and durations of walking trips for different purposes across population groups were compared using nationally representative data from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). Distance decay functions were used to summarize the distribution of walking distances and durations for different purposes and population subgroups. Data were analyzed in 2011. Results: Sixteen percent of respondents had at least one daily walking trip. The mean and median values for walking distance were 0.7 and 0.5 miles, respectively. For walking duration, the mean and median values were 14.9 and 10 minutes. About 65{\%} of walking trips were more than 0.25 miles in distance, and about 18{\%} of walking trips were more than 1 mile. Large variations were found among various purposes for both distance and duration. The distances and durations of walking for recreation were substantially longer than those for other purposes. People with lower versus higher household income walked longer distances for work but shorter distances for recreation. Conclusions: Only a small fraction of respondents walk, but trips longer than 0.25 miles are common. There is substantial variability in the distance and duration of walking trips by purpose and population subgroups. These differences have implications for developing strategies to increase physical activity through walking. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

In Sydney, Australia, people walk farther to the train than to the bus, the distributions of walking distances are different for each mode, and the trip and demographic characteristics of train and bus users are different. Given the decision to walk to public transport, demographic characteristics such as age, gender, income, and labor force status and trip characteristics such as trip purpose, time of day and week, fare and ticket type, and trip duration are not significant in explaining walking distance to each mode of public transport. The mode of the public transport trip is the most important determinant of walking distance, reflecting the different supply and spacing of each mode. For instance, there are many more bus stops than train stations. The differences between train and bus users suggest that accessibility initiatives for public transport might not be the same for each mode.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: to establish reference values for both comfortable and maximum gait speed and to describe the reliability of the gait speed measures and the correlation of selected variables with them. DESIGN: descriptive and cross-sectional. METHODS: subjects were 230 healthy volunteers. Gait was timed over a 7.62 m expanse of floor. Actual and height normalized speed were determined. Lower extremity muscle strength was measured with a hand-held dynamometer. RESULTS: mean comfortable gait speed ranged from 127.2 cm/s for women in their seventies to 146.2 cm/s for men in their forties. Mean maximum gait speed ranged from 174.9 cm/s for women in their seventies to 253.3 cm/s for men in their twenties. Both gait speed measures were reliable (coefficients {\textgreater} or = 0.903) and correlated significantly with age (r {\textgreater} or = -0.210), height (r {\textgreater} or = 0.220) and the strengths of four measured lower extremity muscle actions (r = 0.190-0.500). The muscle action strengths most strongly correlated with gait speed were nondominant hip abduction (comfortable speed) and knee extension (maximum speed). CONCLUSIONS: these normative values should give clinicians a reference against which patient performance can be compared in a variety of settings. Gait speed can be expected to be reduced in individuals of greater age and of lesser height and lower extremity muscle strength.},

The data used in this study included individual records of transit trips made in the morning peak period 6–9 a.m. on a regular week day. The results show that the dense transit route network in the downtown area results in lower walk access distances than in other parts of the city. Also, dwelling type of the household, number of vehicles available in the household, and transit service frequency show a noteworthy relationship with access distance in Toronto. In general, it was found that around 60{\%} of transit users in Toronto live within the transit service area of 300 m airline distance assumed by the transit service provider. These results indicate that people in Toronto are willing to walk further to access transit than assumed existing standards for transit service areas.},

	abstract = {The 0.5-mile distance has become accepted for gauging a transit station's catchment area in the United States and is the de facto standard for the planning of U.S. transit-oriented developments (TODs). Planners and researchers use transit catchment areas not only to make predictions about transit ridership and transit impacts (socioeconomic and on land use) but also to prescribe regulations (e.g., relaxing restrictive zoning or carving out TODs for financial plans). This radius is loosely based on the distance that people are willing to walk to transit, but the same reason- ing has been used to justify other transit catchment areas. Station-level variables from 1,449 high-capacity American transit stations in 21 cit- ies are used to determine whether a clear benchmark between distance and ridership provides a norm for station-area planning and prediction. Results indicate that, for the purposes of predicting station-level transit ridership, different catchment areas have little influence on a model's predictive power. This finding suggests that transit agencies should use the easiest, most readily available data when estimating direct demand models. The evidence is less clear for prescribing land use policy. Nev- ertheless, results support the use of a 0.25-mile catchment area around transit for jobs and a 0.5-mile catchment area for population. Even though these distances probably will vary, depending on the location and the study purpose, the distances are good starting points for consid- ering transit-oriented land use policy or collecting labor-intensive data, such as surveys, about transit-adjacent firms or households.

abstract = {The quality of transport networks does not only depend on the quality of the individual links and nodes, but also on the way these nodes and links function in the context of multimodal networks. In the present paper we focus on multimodal trips where the railways are the main transport mode. We discuss detour and frequency problems related to multimodal transport chains. Local accessibility of railway stations is an important determinant of railway use in the Netherlands. We find that the propensity to make use of rail services by people living in the ring between 500 to 1000 meters from a railway station is about 20{\%} lower than of people living at most 500 meters away from railway stations. At distances between 1.0 and 3.5 km the distance decay effect is about 30{\%}, and above this distance it may reach values up to 50{\%}. Non-motorized transport modes are dominant at both the home-end and the activity-end. A rather unique feature of the home-end access mode is the high share of the bicycle. More than one out of every three passengers uses the bike on the trip from home to station. At the activity-end the share of the bike is much smaller, because of the asymmetry in the supply of this transport mode in the home versus activity-end. This explains the dominant position of walking as the access mode at the activity-end. Implications are discussed for physical planning and the need for facilities near railway stations.},
