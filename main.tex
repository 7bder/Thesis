% Most valuable thing duing Ph.D., the overview.
The journey of PhD has both pleasure and pain. But I deeply trust that what I went through today, both the good and the bad, will be the valuable life experience in the future. If mentioning the most memorable thing during my PhD, maybe I would say the process of shifting the way of thinking from a common people to a real researcher, even I can say this is the most valuable thing that I obtained after rather than the degree certificate during the more than 4 years .

% 我要谢！谢全家十八辈儿！
I am not willing to describe the period of PhD in a suffering way, but frankly, I have to say that without the support and help from various people around me, I should have already stopped my feet underway. There are so many thanks I would like to say, please let me express my appreciation one by one.

% 我要谢老大
First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Zhao Shichen, my supervisor, that the guidance and instruction he gave to me not only helped me in my studies but more in work and life attitude. The time of drinking with Prof. Zhao is also joyful and memorable. The drinking party also shortened the distance between us students and professor, for which I appreciated a lot. It's my luck that I came to Zhao laboratory doing research, thank to Prof. Zhao again for teaching me so many things.

% co-supervisor
I would like to express my appreciation for my co-supervisors, Prof. Sakai Takeru and Prof. Divigalpitiya Prasanna for giving me so many comments on my dissertation. They also gave me the instruction in the designing workshop. Even though I am not working on the architecture design, the sense of design they inspired me must be a valuable wealth of the future.

% 感谢刘泽
I am grateful that I met many nice senior fellow students when I just entered our laboratory. They taught me so many tips and experiences in both daily life and research, which helped me a lot in my later days. I would like to thank my brother Liu Ze, who should also be my teacher, for giving me so many comments and advice on my research. 

% 谢陈思婷帮我搞论文
I would like to thank the other fellow students in our laboratory for their feedback on my papers. Communication is an important segment of research, a research without readers has no meaning. Thanks to everyone for the patients. Especially I would like to thank Li He, Chen Siting, and Sun Xia for helping a lot in checking my messy English also in organizing the logic of my papers. 

% 谢日本小鬼子教我日语
Also, I have to say thanks to the cute Japanese fellows, although not for helping me in research. They talked with me, taught me language and culture, made me adapt Japanese life soon. My period in Japan is so enrich and interesting, a large part of which can be attributed to them. In particular, I would like to say thanks to Yoshioka Daiki, Ikutake Shin, and Higuchi Go, thanks for their accompany in countless overnights.

% 感谢韩博士家的麻将，火锅，炒菜
One more thing, as we know relax is also important especially during the relatively arduous PhD period, how to spend the boring time and adjust the pace of work is always a serious problem puzzling PhD students. Dr. Han Guofeng, my ex-roommate at Kyushu University International House, and his current-roommate provided us the party place in his apartment, where we have hotpot party and even play mahjong. Thanks to my mahjong partners, together with them a lot of happiness are created, boring time is spent, thus accomplishing research with a better status.

% 最后的最重要，我要感谢China, CSC，他们给我钱
The most important thing always come last, all the expense during the 4 years PhD period is sponsored by China Scholarship Council (CSC). With this money, I clearly know that my country is standing behind me, she gives me confidences to step into a new environment, to face the world. Thanks so much.

Urban transport is an important part of urban planning and management. Urban traffic problems such as traffic congestion, traffic accident, and air pollution, always appear along with the development of the city, while they also restrict the development of the city simultaneously. At present, Japan is facing serious problems of aging society and low birthrate. Reflected in the local central cities of Japan, these problems are showing the trends of the migration to the urban edge and the spread of urban areas. What followed is the traffic congestion and the continuous increase in the traffic mode share of private cars. From the perspective of environmental protection and the full use of social public resources, how to improve the use of public transportation has become an important issue in all Japanese cities. To promote the utilization of public transit, it is necessary to explore and understand the determinants of transit ridership, based on which the specific improvement plan can be proposed regarding land use, buildings and facilities.

% 主旨，目的
% 因此，本文最基本的目的是解释客流量。具体来看，目的可以分为3个。
With such background and demand, this study aims to explore and quantitatively analyze the determinants affecting urban rail transit by using the rail transit system of Fukuoka, which is a typical local central city in Japan, as the study case, so as to provide references to future planning. Around the purpose of this research, this dissertation mainly explores and discusses the determinants of Fukuoka rail transit ridership from 3 aspects: passenger attributes, environmental factors around the station, and passenger transfer between station and station. According to the research purpose proposed, this dissertation is organized into six chapters, and the contents of each chapter are as follows. 

% 具体研究的内容，包含方法
% chp1
In chapter 1, the research background is elaborated. Firstly,  the overall research purpose is put forward on the basis of the practical problems existing in most cities around the world (particularly in the local central cities of Japan). Then through the collation and summary of the previous studies, some specific research questions area extracted in terms of the details in analyzing the determinants of rail transit ridership. Finally, the rail transit system of Fukuoka City is selected as the research object, the content of this dissertation is organized around the research purpose and the specific research points.

Chapter 2 uses on passengers’ attributes, including socio-economic characteristics and trip chain information, to explain the variation in walking access among individuals. The purpose is to grasp the utilization trend of rail transit. It has been confirmed in many studies that there is no linear relationship between the dependent variable of walking access and the explanatory variables. To make an intensive exploration of the relationship between walking access and passengers’ attributes, this study examines the attribute characteristics of passengers that walked the given walking duration or more, thus trying to explain the preference for walking access. The research object is the probability that passengers walk the given threshold of walking duration or more. For the analysis method, the ANOVA is used to extract the effective passenger attribute at each given walking duration. Then the extracted effective attributes are used to predict the probability that the walking access is greater than the given threshold. The accuracy of the prediction is verified from the perspective of both group and individual. Three thresholds of walking duration 5, 8, 13-minute are selected to examine in this chapter. From the results of feature extraction and probability prediction, passengers with the attributes of more than 65 years of age, unemployment, and business, private or going home travel purposes are more likely to walk for more than 5-minute; passengers who travel for business, private or going home purposes are more inclined to accept a walking duration longer than 8-minute; only the passengers with private travel purposes are more likely to accept a more than 13-minute walking duration. According to the evaluation of the prediction results, the passenger attributes extracted from the 5-minute walking duration have relatively strong explanatory power in explaining the walking duration preference. The explanatory power at 13-minute walking duration is slightly weaker than that at the 5-minute threshold. The prediction at 8-minute walking duration has the lowest accuracy.

Chapter 3 examines all the subway stations in Fukuoka City regarding the characteristics of rail transit ridership, also the characteristics of land use around the station. The subway stations are classified into 5 types (low-density residence, high-density residence, downtown commerce, office, and education respectively) according to the land use characteristics, then the characteristics of transit ridership are summarized in terms of the 5 types. On the basis of fully grasping the characteristics of both transit ridership and land use, the relationship between land use and passenger flow is estimated by Quantification I Method. It is concluded that the building area of commerce and office is important on affecting transit ridership, while population density plays an important role in the growth of transit ridership.

Chapter 4 explores and estimates the influencing factors of transit ridership at station level. Aiming at a small sample case of Fukuoka City, this chapter proposes a method to extract effective influencing factors of the regression model, and finally, 9 effective indicators are identified. Also, to tackle the problem resulted from the spatial autocorrelation of explanatory variables, Moran index is introduced to describe this spatial autocorrelation thus discriminating the global and local indicators. Then the Mixed Geographically Weighted Regression model is used to estimate the impact on transit ridership. The results show that all the 9 selected indicators are statistically significant. Among them, raising the indicators of official office area, transportation facility area, land use aggregation, transfer station, bicycle parking, and bus accessibility can lead to an increase in rail transit ridership. According to the comparison of the residuals and the spatial distribution of residuals, it is clear that the results from MGWR have a significant improvement than that from OLR.

%chp5
Chapter 5 examines the influence of land use types on passengers' choice of destination from the perspective of OD transit ridership. This chapter proposes that the probability of choosing destination station will be affected by the type of land use around the departure stations. Based on this argument, this research question is converted to a binary choice issue and is described by the logistic regression. Using the classification of stations obtained from chapter 2, several typical stations selected from each type are used as the research objects, they are used as the destination station to analyze if the land use types around the departure station affect the probability of choosing them as the destination. According to the results of logistic regression, the land use type around the departure station has significant influences on the probability of choosing the destination, based on which the argument proposed in this chapter can be verified. The results show that the probability of choosing a destination belongs to low-density residence type has no tend of raising regarding to the variation on land use types of the departure station. For the destination station of any type, the education land use of the departure station contributes to an increase in the probability of being chosen as the destination. The probability of destination station being chosen tend to decrease if the land use type is similar between the departure and destination stations.

%chp6
Chapter 6 summarizes the findings and conclusions of each chapter in this dissertation. In the recommendation part, the feasibility of integrating passenger attributes, environmental factors around the station, and ridership transfer between OD station to predict rail transit ridership is put forward, which is expected to be used to improve the accuracy of transit ridership forecasting.
