% Most valuable thing duing Ph.D., the overview.
The journey of PhD has both pleasure and pain, but I deeply trust that all I went through today, either good or bad, will be the valuable life experience in the future. If mentioning the most memorable thing during my PhD, maybe I would say the process of shifting the way of thinking from a common people to a real researcher, even I can say this is the most valuable thing that I obtained after rather than the degree certificate during the more than 4 years .

% 我要谢！谢全家十八辈儿！
I am not willing to describe the period of PhD in a suffering way, but frankly, I have to say that without the support and help from various people around me, I should have already stopped my feet underway. There are so many thanks I would like to say, please let me express my appreciation one by one.

% 我要谢老大
First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Zhao Shichen, my supervisor, for the guidance and instruction not only in my studies but more in work and life attitude. The time of drinking with Prof. Zhao is also joyful and memorable, that chance of drinking together also shortened the distance between us students and professor, for which I appreciated a lot. It's my luck that I came to Zhao laboratory doing research, thank to Prof. Zhao again for teaching me so many things.

% co-supervisor
I would like to express my appreciation to my co-supervisors, Prof. Sakai Takeru and Prof. Divigalpitiya Prasanna, for their instruction in the designing workshop. Even though I am not working on the architecture design, the sense of design they inspired me must be a valuable wealth in the future.

% 感谢刘泽
I feel very grateful that I met many nice senior fellow students when I just entered our laboratory. They taught me so many tips and experiences in both daily life and research, which helped me a lot in my later days. I would like to thank my brother Liu Ze, who should also be my teacher, for giving me so many comments and advices on my research. 

% 谢陈思婷帮我搞论文
I would like to thank the other fellow students in our laboratory for their feedback on my papers. Communication is an important segment of research, a research without readers has no meaning. Thanks to everyone for the their patients. Especially I would like to thank Li He, Chen Siting, and Sun Xia for helping a lot in checking my messy English also in organizing the logic of my papers. 

% 谢日本小鬼子教我日语
Also, I have to say thanks to the cute Japanese fellows, although not for helping me in research. They talked with me, taught me language and culture, made me adapt Japanese life soon. My period in Japan is so enrich and interesting, a large part of which can be attributed to them. In particular, I would like to say thanks to Yoshioka Daiki, Ikutake Shin, and Higuchi Go, thanks for their accompany in countless overnights.

% 感谢韩博士家的麻将，火锅，炒菜
One more thing, as we know relax is also important especially during the relatively arduous PhD period, how to spend the boring time and adjust the pace of work is always a serious problem puzzling PhD students. Dr. Han Guofeng, my ex-roommate at Kyushu University International House, and his current-roommate provided us the party place in his apartment, where we have hotpot party and even playing mahjong in leisure time. Thanks to my mahjong partners, together with them a lot of happiness is created, boring time is spent, thus accomplishing research with a better status.

% 最后的最重要，我要感谢China, CSC，他们给我钱
The most important thing always come last, all the expense during the 4 years PhD period is sponsored by China Scholarship Council (CSC). With this money, I clearly know that my country is standing behind me, she gives me confidences to step into a new environment, to face the world. Thanks to my country.

%chp1
Urbanization caused many social problems related to urban traffic in both developing and developed countries, of which although the problems are manifested in various aspects, in essence, they can be attributed to the demand for sustainability. Giving priority to the development of public transport has been widely accepted as the effective means to deal with the problem in the sustainability of urban traffic. To decrease the share of motorized travel and increase the willingness of using public transit, a lot of measures aimed at attracting people to use public transit were proposed and implemented. However, the implementation of these measures is not as simple as building rail transit stations, then waiting for people to come. Understanding the factors influencing rail transit ridership is always central and fundamental to decisions on this issue.

% 主旨，目的
% 因此，本文最基本的目的是解释客流量。具体来看，目的可以分为4个。
With the requirement of sustainable development, the primary purpose of this research is carried out: analyzing the determinants of transit ridership, thus providing references for the coordinated planning of urban and transit. Corresponding to the topics and previous studies, the specific research questions are proposed as follow: 1. to explain walking preference to transit stations in terms of socio-Demographic characteristics thus exploring the determinants of catchment areas; 2. to explore the characteristics and trends of changes in transit ridership in terms of land use and facilities around the stations; 3. to find an approach for screening effective influencing factors; 4. to describe the relationship of transit ridership between stations and stations.

% 具体研究的内容，包含方法
% chp2
On the first question, this research examines the feature distribution of individual characteristics at several thresholds of walking duration, thus trying to explore the willingness of walking duration to transit stations. The model of random forest decision is introduced to explain the relationship from the perspective of probability. The results showed a quantitative relationship of surveyed walking durations and passengers' individual characteristics, which is expected to be used in planning catchment areas of rail transit station or estimating the catchment areas of existing stations.

%chp3
As to the second question, the annual change of transit ridership in the past ten years is investigated, also the changes in land use around the transit stations during the same period are also examined, based on which the stations are classified into 5 types. On the basis of mastering the characteristics of change in both transit ridership and land use, a preliminary analysis of the determinants of transit ridership is conducted.

%chp4
The third question is answered through the exploratory regression decreasing the risk of type I and type II errors in statistic when identifying the valid variables that should be put into the regression model. The specific influence of screened valid variables is then estimated using mixed geographically weighted regression. The results gave the factors actually playing a role on influencing transit ridership, and indicate the influence quantitatively. 

%chp5
For the fourth question, the relationship of transit ridership between stations and stations is analyzed from the perspective of TOD considering the land use within the station catchment area. This question is converted into a binary choice problem, which is estimated by the logistic regression model. The results showed that for passengers the variations in land use in departure stations can lead to variations in the choice of destination stations.

% 讨论和建议
%chp6
Finally, several recommendations are proposed: 1. before estimating transit ridership a general process of screening valid factors is necessary; 2. transit station is not an independent station but one station in a system, the transit ridership should be examined from the perspective of line or network level. 3. accuracy estimation for catchment area needs further exploration. \\ \\ \\
